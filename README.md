Eclipse is a newborn typeface based on a completely unified radius of circles and the width of vertical lines, which gives both noble and industrial imprints.
Seen from afar, bold and robust vertical lines attract your eyes, from close you will notice the curvaceousness of circles.
Appropriate for product logotype, usage as standard text is out of expectation.
Designed by Minato Masayuki in May 2023.
This is an assigned work for the course ‘computational design/design strategy’ at SFC, Keio College.
