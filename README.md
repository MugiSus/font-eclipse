Eclipse is a newborn typeface based on the completely unified radius of circles and thickness of vertical lines, which gives both noble and industrial imprints. Seen from afar, bold and robust vertical lines attract your eyes, but from close, you will notice the curvaceousness of its circles. Appropriate for logotype or product design, use as regular text is not expected. Designed by Minato Masayuki in May 2023, this is an assigned work for the course ‘computational design/design strategy’ at SFC, Keio College.
